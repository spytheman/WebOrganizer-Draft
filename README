This project is an online calendar/organizer, to test Java and
NetBeans abilities to handle medium sized web projects.

This line is added from WinXP (by using git clone url: https://spytheman@github.com/spytheman/WebOrganizer-Draft.git and entering the user's password in TortoiseGIT ).

And this is from Linux to test that the ordinary account continue to
work as expected.

Another change from WinXP land ... this time from different user 
(to make a clear distinction when the virtual WinXP is used).
