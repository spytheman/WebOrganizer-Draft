This project is an online calendar/organizer, to test Java and
NetBeans abilities to handle medium sized web projects.

This line is added from WinXP (by using git clone url: https://spytheman@github.com/spytheman/WebOrganizer-Draft.git and entering the user's password in TortoiseGIT ).

And this is from Linux to test that the ordinary account continue to
work as expected.

Another change from WinXP land ... this time from different user 
(to make a clear distinction when the virtual WinXP is used).

And ... this change is from within the NetBeans IDE, using the Git plugin, installed using the Tools->Plugins dialog.


The persistence is implemented using the h2 jdbc driver.

How to start the DB server:
===================================================
   1) open a new shell, and execute these commands in it:
  
   cd /opt/NetBeansProjects/WebOrganizerPersistence
   h2/start_h2_server.sh
   
How to stop the DB server:
===================================================
   1) Find the shell that you opened at step 1. Press Ctrl-C .


By default, the database is located in the res/database/main.h2.db
file in this project, and contains 1 schema named also main , which
contains a pristine project DB without any data in it.
